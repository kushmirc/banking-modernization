# Lessons Learned

## Database Case Sensitivity Issue (July 2025)

### The Problem
Login functionality worked perfectly on local development environment but failed on EC2 deployment with no obvious error messages in the UI.

### Root Cause
MySQL database name case sensitivity differences between operating systems:
- **Local Environment (Mac/Windows)**: MySQL treats database names as case-insensitive by default
- **EC2 Environment (Ubuntu Linux)**: MySQL treats database names as case-sensitive when `lower_case_table_names=0`

The application code used lowercase `bns` while the database was created as uppercase `BNS`:
```java
// In MySqlDataStoreUtilities.java
conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/bns","root","Passw0rd!");
```

### Discovery Process
1. Initial assumption was database connectivity, but MySQL was running and accessible
2. Added debug logging to servlet classes to trace execution flow
3. Discovered "Database connection: unsuccessful" in logs
4. Found NullPointerException due to failed database connection
5. Identified case mismatch between code (`bns`) and actual database (`BNS`)

### Solution
Changed the connection string to use uppercase database name:
```java
conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/BNS","root","Passw0rd!");
```

### Key Takeaways
1. **Environment Parity**: Always verify database configurations match exactly between environments
2. **Case Sensitivity**: Be aware of OS-specific differences, especially with Linux deployments
3. **Debug Logging**: Adding systematic debug statements is crucial for troubleshooting
4. **MySQL Configuration**: Check `lower_case_table_names` variable when debugging database issues

### Prevention for Future
- Use consistent naming conventions (preferably lowercase) for database names
- Document environment-specific configurations
- Include environment verification in deployment procedures
- Add connection testing as part of deployment validation

## Servlet Naming Confusion

### The Problem
The legacy application has confusing and counterintuitive servlet mappings that made debugging difficult.

### What We Found
```xml
<!-- /customerlogin URL is handled by Login class -->
<servlet>
    <servlet-name>customerlogin</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>Login</servlet-class>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>customerlogin</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/customerlogin</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>

<!-- /login URL is handled by CustomerLogin class -->
<servlet>
    <servlet-name>CustomerLogin</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>CustomerLogin</servlet-class>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>CustomerLogin</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/login</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
```

### Issues Identified
1. URL patterns don't match their handler class names (backwards/confusing)
2. Inconsistent naming conventions (lowercase vs CamelCase)
3. Two different servlets handling similar functionality
4. Makes debugging and maintenance difficult

### Modernization Recommendations
- Use consistent naming: servlet name = class name
- URL patterns should intuitively match their purpose
- Consolidate duplicate functionality
- Follow REST conventions in Spring Boot migration

## Tomcat Version Migration

### The Challenge
- Local development used Tomcat 8 (javax.servlet.*)
- EC2 deployment used Tomcat 10 (jakarta.servlet.*)

### What Worked Well
The migration script successfully converted all imports from javax to jakarta, showing the value of automated migration tools.

### Learning Points
1. Always document the exact version of application servers used
2. Be aware of major API changes between versions (Java EE â†’ Jakarta EE)
3. Test deployments on matching server versions when possible
